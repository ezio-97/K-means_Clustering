# K-means_Clustering
K-means Clustering using Numpy 

A small attempt at understanding the basic of K-means which is a type of unsupervised machine learning algorithm. The data is a 'Matlab' file and was taken from the assignment 
series of 'Machine Learning' Coursera by Andrew Ng. There are more efficient ways of doing this using various frameworks but if you are intrested to dive into the skeleton of the 
said process, this may find you well. The code may not be free from errors and can be optimised a lot!! Happy Learning!
